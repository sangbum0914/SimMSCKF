# SimMSCKF

It's a python-based simple simulation of Multi-State Constraints Kalman Filter (MSCKF) with ROS2.

Estimator can be operated directly using main_sim.py.

The simulation environment data (IMU, Vision, ...) is saved in the sim_data.pkl.

Simulation environment is changeable through gen_traj.py in gen_sim directory
